WHAT IS DEBUGGING?

* Debugging is one of the broadest topics in Software Engineering. 

* It is a process to find subtle and remove bugs, and errors, and to understand the flow of the code as well. 

* It is a must-have skill for all Java developers because debugging can help in locating the bugs which are not visible during code reviews.
 
* Let’s discuss the steps to debug the code in eclipse.

--------------------------------------------Step by Step Implementation-------------------------------------

-->Step 1: Start with setting Breakpoints = we need to set breakpoints in the code to stop the execution at your desired location.
 
                                            While running the program in debug mode it will temporarily stop execution at a particular point in the code.
                                          
                                            So, there are some ways to set breakpoints in code. 
                                         
               1) Put the cursor on a line in code which you want to set as a breakpoint then press Control + Shift + B.

               2) Double-click on the left margin or right-click in the editor and select “Toggle Breakpoint“.

               3) You will see a blue dot will appear next to that line.

-->Step 2: Activate Debug Mode = Now to debug the project have different ways in Eclipse.

                              FIRST WAY:
                              
                              1) Right-click on the project which you want to debug and select “Debug As” then “Java Application”.
                                                        
                              2) Eclipse asks you want to switch to the Debug Perspective once the compiler reached the first breakpoint.
                              
                              3) Once you click on Switch, you will see Debug Mode in eclipse.
                              
                              
                              SECOND WAY:
                              
                              On the right corner of the eclipse editor have an Icon debug double Click on it. You will observe that debug mode is activated. 
                              
                              
-->Step 3: In the toolbar of Eclipse editor appears several buttons for controlling the flow of execution of the program.

                Resume	        F8        	Execution of the program until the next breakpoint is reached.
                
                Terminate 	 Control + F2	    To stop the execution of code.
                
                Step Into	    F5	        Executes the current line of code and goes to the next line of code. 
                 
                Step Over	    F6	        Executes the current line of code and goes back to the previous line. 
                
                
--> Conclusion

* For every Java Developer having good debugging skills is necessary.

* Tt can be got by practice there are not any particular techniques to learn and get the debugging skills for that you need to spend more time and

* learn the different views of debugging this article is for beginners who are just starting their journey as Java developers.
